- This is outlook_interop branch.
- In this branch we are trying to collect the data from outlook using the outlook interop APIs.
- Steps to enable warning on programmatic acces are as follows:
    - Close the running outlook instance if any.
    - Open the outlook in admin mode.
    - Go to File -> Options -> Trust Center -> Trust Center Settings -> Programmatic access -> Select Always warn me about suspicious activity.
